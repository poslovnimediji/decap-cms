The RC is available at []()

The changes are merged to master. The purpose is to enable the community PRs to be easily merged to the main branch.

Tests are updated, working, and passing.

Dependency updates:
- Slate 
- Webpack
- Tostify
- Cypress

React remains at verion 16 for now, but an update is already in the works. We decided to omit this update for now, as it would prolong the release process.
